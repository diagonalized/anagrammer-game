## IMPORTANT TERMS

### 1. Alphagram

An alphagram is a word or phrase that is written in alphabetical order. For example, the alphagram of the word "alphabet" is "aabehlpt".

### 2. Anagram

An anagram is any word that can be formed by rearranging some or all letters of a word. For example: "bad", "land", and "band" are anagrams of "badland".

Note: anagrams use any letter of the original word exactly once.

### 3. Perfect Anagram

A perfect anagram is an anagram that uses all the letters of the original word exactly once. For example, "perfect" is a perfect anagram of "prefect".

### 4. Sub-anagram & Sub-alphagram

A sub-anagram is an anagram that uses some or all letters of the original word. For example, "bad" is a sub-anagram of "badland". 

Similarly, a sub-alphagram is an alphagram that uses some letters of the original alphagram.

## FAQ

Q: Why use alphagrams to find anagrams?

A: Alphagrams are a natural way to sort words and phrases. They are easy to generate and compare, and they are a good way to find anagrams. Perfect anagrams have the same alphagram.
